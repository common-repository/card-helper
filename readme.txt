Creates and Manages gift card for customers on checkout


== Description ==
This is a WooCommerce extension plugin that helps customers customize a gift card on checkout. It’s simple and easy to be used.

What exactly happens is that, a table is displayed on the checkout, with row one having the filter listing.
The filter listing is categories for each card content. Example. “Happy birthday Joe” can be belong to “Birthdays” category.

When a user clicks on that save row, a drop down occurs with the other listing, when one is chosen, the list of contents under that category will show.

Also this plugin features a textarea on the left handed side, where the customer can edit the content that he selects. When a customer selects a content title, the content shows up in the textarea.
